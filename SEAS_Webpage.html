<h3>About Me</h3>

<p>I am a first year Masters student in Electrical Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania. My undergraduate work and projects have been in the areas of Networking,<br>
Wireless Communications and Computer Vision. I have also researched Stochastic Processes and Calculus, Random Processes and Information Theory. I aim to continue<br>
working in these fields during the course of my Masters. Courses like Engineering Economics and Mathematical Programming are ones that really interest me and I am<br>
on the lookout for opportunities where I can use the expertise I gain with these industry oriented courses in the areas of my research.</p> 

<h3>Courses</h3>
<ol>
<li>TCOM 500: Introduction to Networks and Protocols</li>
<li>ESE 504: Introduction to Optimization Theory</li>
<li>ESE 540: Engineering Economics</li>
</ol>
<p>In the Spring semester I plan to take Wireless Communications, Advanced Networking Protocols and Engineering Enterpreneurship.</p>

<h3>Job Interests</h3>
</p>I am looking at gaining experience in industry once I am done with my Masters. I can see myself doing this either as a Networking or Wireless Communications<br>
Engineer, a Cost Engineer/Engineering Economist or an Analyst or Technical Consultant with my preferences not necessarily in the order stated.</p>   

<h3>Hobbies</h3>
<p>I am an avid player of Soccer and Tennis and a fanatical Chelsea FC fan! I also love reading books and listening to all genres of music.<br>
Anyone in the Philadelphia area looking to play soccer/catch a movie (Thursday nights @ $5), feel free to contact me!</p>
